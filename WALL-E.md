Data Collection: At the start of the trading day, the bot would collect the necessary price data. This could be the closing prices from the previous days, or it could be a combination of open, high, low, and close prices, depending on the specific implementation of the SMA.

Calculation of SMA: The bot would calculate the SMA based on the collected data. For example, if it's using a 50-day SMA, it would calculate the average of the closing prices for the past 50 days.

Monitoring the Market: Throughout the trading day, the bot would monitor the market and continuously update the SMA as new price data comes in. It would also compare the current price to the SMA.

Generating Signals: If the bot is using a strategy like the Golden Cross, it would generate a buy signal when the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, and a sell signal when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.

Executing Trades: When a buy or sell signal is generated, the bot would execute the corresponding trade.

Logging and Analysis: The bot would log all trades and potentially other data for analysis. This can be used to evaluate the performance of the bot and adjust the strategy if necessary.

End of Day: At the end of the trading day, the bot would update its data with the day's closing price and prepare for the next trading day.
