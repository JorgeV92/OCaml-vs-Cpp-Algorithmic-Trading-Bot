## Introduction

The trading bots utilize the Simple Moving Average (SMA) algorithm with the Golden Cross method to execute trades. This algorithm was chosen due to its effectiveness in identifying potential bullish market trends when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, which is known as a Golden Cross. The bots fetch real-time stock market data using the Alpaca API, a platform that provides an easy-to-use RESTful API for stock trading. Trades are then executed based on the signals generated by the SMA algorithm and the Golden Cross method.
